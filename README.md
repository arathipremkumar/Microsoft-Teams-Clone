# Video-call-app
This is a one-to-one video call app  built in python using Agora SDK. 
Two people can connect in a channel using the App-id from agora.io

Python is very convenient to work with. It is High level, Interpreted, Object-oriented, Interactive, Modular, Dynamic, Portable and Extensible in C++ & C.
Its advantages are that its easy to read and write,low maintainance cost, no harms for the software bugs  and it also allows integration with other languages.
Its slow execution speed and large memory consumption makes it weak in mobile computing. But,as my task is to create an application that works on the web, python is a good option.
