# Vedio-call-app
This is an Agora one-to-one vedio call build in python. 
Two people can connect in a channel using the App-id from agora.io

Python is very convenient to work with. It is High level, Interpreted, Object-oriented, Interactive, Modular, Dynamic, Portable and Extensible in C++ & C.
Its advanteges are that its easy to read and write,low maintainance cost, no harms for the software bugs  and it also allows integration with other languages.
Its slow execution speed and large memory consumption makes it weak in mobile computing. But,as my task is to create an application that works on the desktop, I would go for python.
